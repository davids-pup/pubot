# pubot [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PageUpPeopleOrg/pubot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PageUpPeopleOrg/pubot)


Pubot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework and was initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot] using [slacks hubot][slack-hubot] adapter.

This README is intended to help get you started. It should be improved as we add functionality :beer:

### Contributing

Although pubot has some fun interactions it can also be used for useful tasks such as triggering builds and notifying us of application errors etc.

We use travis ci which will deploy any commits on master to production - for instant gratification.

### Set up

    git clone https://github.com/PageUpPeopleOrg/pubot.git .
    npm install -g coffee-script
    npm install

Just that simple, if node or npm is not available follow, [this blog][treehouse-blog] might be of help.

### Running locally

There are two things here,

1. Running locally to test your scripts

* Windows

    `"bin/hubot" --adapter shell`

* Mac/Linux

    `./bin/hubot --adapter shell`

2. Running locally to verify the deployment (docker changes)

This is where vagrant gets handy.
Following are the series of commands that should take you there to verify the pubot.

    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh
    $ docker run pageup/bot /src/devrun


### Scripting

An example script is included at `scripts/example.coffee`, so check it out to
get started, along with the [Scripting Guide](scripting-docs).

For many common tasks, there is a good chance someone has already written a script, check github etc.

[scripting-docs]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md

### External-scripts

There will inevitably be functionality that everyone will want. Instead of
writing it yourself, you can use existing plugins.

Hubot is able to load plugins from third-party `npm` packages. This is the
recommended way to add functionality to your hubot. You can get a list of
available hubot plugins on [npmjs.com](npmjs) or by using `npm search`:

    % npm search hubot-scripts panda
    NAME             DESCRIPTION                        AUTHOR DATE       VERSION KEYWORDS
    hubot-pandapanda a hubot script for panda responses =missu 2014-11-30 0.9.2   hubot hubot-scripts panda
    ...


To use a package, check the package's documentation, but in general it is:

1. Use `npm install --save` to add the package to `package.json` and install it
2. Add the package name to `external-scripts.json` as a double quoted string

You can review `external-scripts.json` to see what is included by default.
