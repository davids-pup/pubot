# pubot [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PageUpPeopleOrg/pubot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PageUpPeopleOrg/pubot)


pubot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot] using [slacks hubot][slack-hubot] adapter.

This README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve
to talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality he
has, etc!

### contributing

From being a fun bot to becoming lean automation/communication funny-bot requires contributions, if not how?

There is CI set up which will deploy any commits on the master - for instant gratification.

### Running pubot Locally

There are two things here,

1. Running locally to test your scripts

    ``bin/hubot --adapter shell``

    you may not need the quotations in a linux terminal.

2. Running locally to verify the deployment (docker changes)

This is where vagrant gets handy.
Following are the series of commands that should take you there to verify the pubot.

    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh
    $ docker run pageup/bot /src/devrun


### Scripting

An example script is included at `scripts/example.coffee`, so check it out to
get started, along with the [Scripting Guide](scripting-docs).

For many common tasks, there's a good chance someone has already one to do just
the thing.

### external-scripts

There will inevitably be functionality that everyone will want. Instead of
writing it yourself, you can use existing plugins.

Hubot is able to load plugins from third-party `npm` packages. This is the
recommended way to add functionality to your hubot. You can get a list of
available hubot plugins on [npmjs.com](npmjs) or by using `npm search`:

    % npm search hubot-scripts panda
    NAME             DESCRIPTION                        AUTHOR DATE       VERSION KEYWORDS
    hubot-pandapanda a hubot script for panda responses =missu 2014-11-30 0.9.2   hubot hubot-scripts panda
    ...


To use a package, check the package's documentation, but in general it is:

1. Use `npm install --save` to add the package to `package.json` and install it
2. Add the package name to `external-scripts.json` as a double quoted string

You can review `external-scripts.json` to see what is included by default.
